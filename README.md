# **Radar Quality Index Processing**

This repository contains the full processing scripts developed for the **Quality Index (Q)** applied to weather radar reflectivity data from the XRAD C‑band radar network of the *Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya (SMC)*. The software computes gate‑level quality indicators, transforms them into Cartesian radar products, and generates network‑wide composites suitable for operational meteorology.

To see the updated version, go to https://github.com/meteocat/QI_radar.

## **Data Format**

### ▶ **Input Files**

The pipeline requires the following input data to be configured in a new configuration file named `config.txt` (take example from the `config_template.txt`):

- **Raw Radar Data Files**: IRIS format (.RAW) files containing polar radar reflectivity data from the XRAD C-band radar network. Examples of such files can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/meteocat/QI_radar_data.

- **Auxiliary Data**:
  - DEM files (GeoTIFF format) for terrain correction, specified in `config.txt`.
  - Climatological echo tops data (NetCDF format) for quality index computation (`HIST_TOP12.nc`).

- **Configuration File**: `config.txt` - A text file specifying processing parameters, including:
  - Initial and final UTC times for processing (note that the final time is not processed).
  - Volume scan type (VOLA, VOLB, or VOLBC). Choose according to the desired products.
  - CAPPI height in meters.
  - Cartesian grid resolution in meters. Note that modifying this parameter will significantly affect processing time.
  - Raw data directory path.
  - Processed data directory path (where output products are saved).
  - Paths to Digital Elevation Model (DEM) files for short-range and long-range processing.
  - Temporal storage directory name for individual radar PPI fields.
  - Path to echo tops 12dBZ climatology file.

### ▶ **Output Files**

The pipeline generates the following composite products as NetCDF (.nc) files organized by volume type, product type, composite type, and date:

- **CAPPI (Constant Altitude Plan Position Indicator)**: Cartesian reflectivity fields at a specified height, with MAX-Z (maximum reflectivity) and MAX-QI (maximum quality index) composites.
- **LUE (Lowest Usable Elevation)**: Products from the lowest usable elevation angles, with MAX-Z and MAX-QI composites.

Each output file contains variables:
- `Z`: Reflectivity (dBZ)
- `QI`: Quality Index (dimensionless, 0-1)
- `RAD`: Radar identifier chosen by the composite criteria (integer)
- `ELEV`: Elevation angle used (degrees)

## **Visualization**

Visualization output may be generated using the ```plotComposite.py``` script following this command:

- If only wanting to visualise: ```python plotComposite.py [product_file_path.nc]```
- If wanting to save png: ```python plotComposite.py s [product_file_path.nc] [saving_directory]```
