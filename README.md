# **Radar Quality Index Processing**

This repository contains the full processing scripts developed for the **Quality Index (Q)** applied to weather radar reflectivity data from the XRAD C‑band radar network of the *Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya (SMC)*. The software computes gate‑level quality indicators, transforms them into Cartesian radar products, and generates network‑wide composites suitable for operational meteorology.

To see the updated version, go to https://github.com/meteocat/QI_radar.

## **Data Format**

### ▶ **Input Files**

The pipeline requires the following input data:

- **Raw Radar Data Files**: IRIS format (.RAW) files containing polar radar reflectivity data from the XRAD C-band radar network. These files are organized in subdirectories under `data/raw/`, named by radar station and date (e.g., `CDVRAW20250921/` for CDV radar on September 21, 2025). Each file corresponds to a volume scan at specific times (VOL-A, VOL-B, and VOL-C).

- **Auxiliary Data**:
  - DEM files (GeoTIFF format) for terrain correction.
  - Climatological echo tops data (NetCDF format) for quality index computation.

- **Configuration File**: `config.txt` - A text file specifying processing parameters, including:
  - Initial and final UTC times for processing (note that the final time is not processed).
  - Volume scan type (VOLA, VOLB, or VOLBC). Choose according to the desired products.
  - CAPPI height in meters.
  - Cartesian grid resolution in meters. Note that modifying this parameter will significantly affect processing time.
  - Paths to Digital Elevation Model (DEM) files for short-range and long-range processing.
  - Path to echo tops climatology data (NetCDF file).

### ▶ **Output Files**

The pipeline generates the following composite products as NetCDF (.nc) files organized by volume type, product type, composite type, and date:

- **CAPPI (Constant Altitude Plan Position Indicator)**: Cartesian reflectivity fields at a specified height, with MAX-Z (maximum reflectivity) and MAX-QI (maximum quality index) composites.
- **LUE (Lowest Usable Elevation)**: Products from the lowest usable elevation angles, with MAX-Z and MAX-QI composites.

Each output file contains variables:
- `Z`: Reflectivity (dBZ)
- `QI`: Quality Index (dimensionless, 0-1)
- `RAD`: Radar identifier chosen by the composite criteria (integer)
- `ELEV`: Elevation angle used (degrees)

## **Visualization**

Visualization output may be generated using the ```plotComposite.py``` script following this command:

- If only wanting to visualise: ```python plotComposite.py [product_file_path.nc]```
- If wanting to save png: ```python plotComposite.py s [product_file_path.nc] [saving_directory]```
